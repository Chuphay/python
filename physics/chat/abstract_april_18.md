This paper introduces a classical field theory of gravity built on modified Maxwell equations and a central physical hypothesis: that mass absorbs zero-point radiation, inducing a net inward momentum flow. Drawing from stochastic electrodynamics (SED), we postulate a Lorentz-invariant radiation field present throughout space, and show that mass acts as a sink for this field up to a frequency cutoff \( \omega_{\text{max}} = m / \hbar \). The resulting momentum density field \( \vec{p} = -\hat{r} \, G m \hbar / r^2 \) replaces curvature with classical flux. We construct a consistent model of a massive particle, demonstrate energy and momentum conservation, and derive an emergent Dirac equation via a spinor transformation. Classical tests of general relativity—Mercury's precession, bending of light, and gravitational redshift—are reproduced at leading order. This approach provides a novel, Lorentz-invariant, classical alternative to quantum gravity and general relativity, and lays a foundation for further exploration of nonlinear effects, vacuum structure, and the origin of mass.

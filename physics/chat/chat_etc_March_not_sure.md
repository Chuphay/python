# Introduction

Physics today stands at an impasse. The Standard Model and general relativity have provided extraordinary insight into the workings of the universe, but their domains remain disjoint: quantum mechanics governs the small, general relativity the large. Despite nearly a century of effort, these two frameworks remain fundamentally incompatible.

Efforts to unify them—most notably string theory—have produced elegant mathematics but no testable predictions. The field of fundamental physics, as argued by Lee Smolin and others, has stagnated, dominated by a narrow set of ideas and institutional inertia. We are still without a coherent, testable theory of gravity that naturally connects to quantum phenomena.

This paper proposes a new classical framework for gravity. It is not an attempt to quantize gravity or retrofit general relativity into a quantum framework. Instead, we start from different assumptions entirely: first, that gravity may follow Maxwell-like field equations (as Heaviside once suggested), and second, that stochastic electrodynamics (as developed by Boyer and others) captures essential aspects of the quantum vacuum.

From these two assumptions, we add one new hypothesis: that mass sinks radiation from the zero-point field, leading to a directional momentum flow. This means that a massive object affects its surrounding space not by curving it, but by pulling energy inward from the radiation field. When photons (or any radiation) pass through this altered region, their momentum is linearly shifted by the interaction with this flow.

This hypothesis is treated as a provisional starting point: a single bold step introduced to see what consequences follow. Importantly, it is mathematically simple, physically intuitive, and it leads to experimentally relevant predictions. As shown later in this paper, it gives rise to familiar general relativistic results—such as light bending and gravitational redshift—and also leads, surprisingly, to a form of the Dirac equation.

This paper is a prototype. Many technical gaps remain. Its purpose is not to claim finality, but to propose a new lens through which gravity and quantum phenomena might be reconsidered. It is offered as a beginning, not an ending.

## Why These Assumptions?

The first assumption—that gravity follows Maxwell-like field equations—traces back to Oliver Heaviside, who in the late 19th century proposed a gravitational analog to electromagnetism. Though ultimately eclipsed by Einstein's general relativity, Heaviside’s idea of a vector-based gravitational theory introduced the notion of a "gravitomagnetic" field. While often overlooked, this approach laid the groundwork for later developments in gravitoelectromagnetism, which appears in linear approximations of general relativity today.

The second assumption is drawn from stochastic electrodynamics (SED), pioneered by Timothy Boyer. SED proposes that empty space is not truly empty, but filled with a fluctuating zero-point radiation field. Remarkably, SED has been shown to reproduce a number of quantum phenomena—including blackbody radiation, atomic ground states, and van der Waals forces—using entirely classical physics and Lorentz-invariant noise.

These assumptions are attractive because they are both rooted in existing physics—Maxwell's equations and classical field theory—and because they avoid speculative constructs like extra dimensions or supersymmetry. While historically marginalized, Heaviside’s and Boyer’s ideas deserve a second look, especially when taken together.

In this paper, they form a coherent base for a new gravitational hypothesis, with concrete predictions and a clear mathematical structure. This is not a unification of GR and QM per se, but a reframing that may make future unification efforts more fruitful.

## Outline of the Paper

The structure of the paper is as follows:


- We begin by re-expressing Maxwell’s equations in a gravitational context, setting the foundation for the theory.
- Next, we examine classical and stochastic solutions to these equations, leading to a model of a massive particle.
- From there, we explore the consequences of our central hypothesis and test it against three classical predictions of general relativity.
- Finally, we arrive at a surprising result: the emergence of the Dirac equation from classical field dynamics.


Each section builds on the previous to support the claim that this classical field theory is a serious candidate for rethinking gravity.




# From Theory to Field Equations

Having laid out the foundational assumptions and hypothesis, we now turn to the mathematical core of the theory. Our first step is to reframe gravity using Maxwell’s equations—not as an analogy, but as a working framework. This section introduces the adapted field equations that will serve as the backbone for all further derivations.

We begin by presenting the gravitational Maxwell equations, then decompose them into solenoidal and irrotational components. These form the basis for describing how both static gravitational fields and radiation behave in this theory.


# Conclusion and Future Work


This paper presents a new classical framework for gravity, grounded in the well-understood structure of Maxwell’s equations and stochastic electrodynamics. Rather than unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics through quantization or curved spacetime, this approach posits a fresh hypothesis: that mass sinks radiation, inducing a momentum transfer field in the zero-point background.

From this foundation, we recover the key classical predictions of general relativity, including the bending of light, the perihelion precession of Mercury, and gravitational redshift. At the same time, we see a striking emergence of the Dirac equation, suggesting deeper connections between gravity, electromagnetism, and quantum phenomena.

Importantly, this theory avoids the infinities that plague both quantum field theory and general relativity. It offers a more intuitive and mathematically consistent platform from which future work can grow. However, much remains to be done: this is a starting point, not a final product.

Open questions include:

- Can this model reproduce all quantum mechanical phenomena via stochastic electrodynamics?
- Does the hypothesis of mass as a radiation sink naturally emerge from the assumptions, or is it fundamental?
-  How do higher-order corrections differ from general relativity, and can these differences be tested?
- What happens in the strong field regime, or at the Planck scale?
- Can this theory resolve the singularity problems in black holes and cosmology?


It is hoped that this paper will spark further investigation and dialogue. The theory is large, and cannot be completed by a single person. Collaboration and critique are not only welcome—they are essential.

## Introduction

This paper presents a new theory of gravity. It is not a unification of general relativity (GR) and quantum mechanics (QM), nor is it a quantum gravity theory in the traditional sense. Instead, it is a fresh approach that discards both GR and QM for much of the analysis and returns to classical physics with two modern updates: a gravitomagnetic field, and a real, Lorentz-invariant zero-point background.

The failures to unify GR and QM for nearly a century suggest that something fundamental has been missing. This theory does not claim to resolve that unification directly, but it proposes a reformulation of gravity that may provide a more natural bridge between classical and quantum descriptions. The approach rests on two assumptions—each grounded in earlier work—and one central hypothesis.

### Assumptions

1. **Heaviside was correct.**

In 1893, Oliver Heaviside proposed an analogy between gravity and electromagnetism. Just as moving electric charges generate magnetic fields, he suggested that moving masses could generate a kind of "gravitational magnetism." Heaviside’s equations mirror Maxwell’s and include both a gravitoelectric field (corresponding to Newtonian gravity) and a gravitomagnetic field (produced by mass currents).

This idea, now known as **gravitoelectromagnetism (GEM)**, has since re-emerged as the weak-field limit of general relativity. In this paper, we assume the GEM framework is correct and treat the gravitomagnetic field not as a byproduct of curved spacetime but as a real classical field. In the weak-field regime, this yields first-order agreement with general relativity on phenomena like the perihelion precession of Mercury, with diverging predictions at higher orders.

2. **Boyer was correct.**

Timothy Boyer’s work in stochastic electrodynamics (SED) showed that a surprising number of quantum phenomena can be derived from classical physics if one assumes that empty space is filled with a background of Lorentz-invariant zero-point radiation. This classical zero-point field, when properly modeled, can reproduce results such as the hydrogen ground state, blackbody radiation spectrum, and van der Waals forces.

We adopt this viewpoint and assume that the vacuum is filled with such a background field. Unlike in quantum mechanics, where zero-point energy is a formal consequence of quantization, here it is a physical, classical field with observable consequences.

### Hypothesis

The central hypothesis is that **mass acts as a sink for zero-point radiation**. As a result, mass induces a momentum-transfer field in surrounding space. When electromagnetic radiation passes through this field, its momentum is shifted linearly. This is expressed as:

$$
\Delta \vec p = \int \vec P ~ dl, \quad \text{with } \vec P = - \hat r \frac {Gm\hbar}{r^2}.
$$

This formulation does not rely on curved spacetime. Instead, gravitational effects emerge as cumulative momentum shifts on radiation moving through a structured classical background.

When applied to the case of light bending around a massive object, this rule yields the same deflection angle as general relativity:

$$
\alpha = \frac{4Gm}{b}.
$$

The agreement is not coincidental. It shows that familiar relativistic effects may be reinterpreted in terms of classical field interactions, rather than spacetime geometry.

### Relationship to GR and QM

General relativity interprets gravity as spacetime curvature. In contrast, the framework presented here models gravitational phenomena as vector field interactions—momentum shifts arising from a mass-induced structure in the zero-point background.

This is not a unification of GR and QM, but it offers a path forward. For example, the **Dirac equation**—central to quantum theory—emerges naturally within this framework, without requiring quantization. Whether this is a coincidence or a sign of deeper consistency remains an open question.

Furthermore, this model avoids the mathematical infinities that plague both GR and quantum field theory. While not rigorously proven here, it suggests a simplified starting point that may resolve some of the longstanding problems in modern physics.

### Outlook

This paper does not claim to be complete. Many questions are left open for future research, including the full implications for quantum phenomena and whether this model can fully account for gravitational dynamics beyond the weak-field limit. Nonetheless, the results presented here offer a compelling new foundation.

By reinterpreting gravity as a classical momentum-transfer phenomenon within a structured zero-point field, this framework opens the door to new ways of thinking about gravity, quantum mechanics, and their potential reconciliation.

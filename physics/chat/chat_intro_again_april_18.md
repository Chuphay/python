\section*{1. Introduction}

This paper proposes a classical field theory of gravity based on modified Maxwell-style equations, supported by a physical hypothesis: that mass absorbs radiation from the surrounding zero-point field. This absorption induces a net directional momentum flow in space, which we argue is responsible for gravitational phenomena.

Rather than attempting to quantize gravity or geometrize spacetime, this model starts from classical electrodynamics and modifies it with physically motivated assumptions. The aim is not to reconcile general relativity and quantum mechanics, but to replace both with a single, consistent classical field framework. The theory is local, Lorentz-invariant, and built to reduce to known predictions of general relativity at leading order.

We test this model by reproducing the three classical experiments associated with general relativity—Mercury’s perihelion precession, bending of light, and gravitational redshift—and then show that under spinor transformation, the governing field equations reduce to the Dirac equation.

\section*{2. Assumptions and Hypothesis}

The theory is based on two primary assumptions, plus one central hypothesis.

\textbf{Assumption 1:} The universe is permeated by a real, Lorentz-invariant zero-point electromagnetic field, following the formalism of stochastic electrodynamics (SED). This field has energy density \( \rho(\omega) \propto \hbar \omega^3 \) per unit frequency, and exists even at absolute zero.

\textbf{Assumption 2:} All massive particles absorb radiation from this background field up to a cutoff frequency \( \omega_{\text{max}} = \frac{m}{\hbar} \). Above this frequency, they are transparent. This absorption is isotropic in the rest frame of the mass.

\textbf{Main Hypothesis:} This absorption induces a net inward momentum flow in the surrounding space, governed by:

\[
\boxed{
\vec{p} = -\hat{r} \frac{G m \hbar}{r^2}
}
\]

This momentum density field exerts directional influence on radiation and matter. It is not a force in the Newtonian sense, but a field effect—emerging from the classical interaction between mass and a fluctuating vacuum. The rest of the paper explores the consequences of treating this hypothesis as physically real.

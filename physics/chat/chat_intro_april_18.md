\section{Introduction}

Physics today remains split across two incompatible regimes: quantum field theory, which governs the microscopic world with stunning accuracy, and general relativity, which describes the gravitational dynamics of massive objects. Despite a century of effort, these frameworks resist unification. Attempts like string theory have produced elegant mathematics but few testable results. Meanwhile, the Standard Model offers no insight into gravity, and GR offers no foothold for quantum phenomena.

This paper proposes a different approach. Rather than quantizing gravity or geometrizing quantum mechanics, we construct a new classical field theory—one grounded in Maxwellian structure and driven by a single added hypothesis.

The theory begins with two assumptions:

1. That gravity can be described by Maxwell-like field equations, as originally suggested by Heaviside in the 19th century.
2. That the vacuum is filled with stochastic zero-point radiation, following the framework of stochastic electrodynamics (SED), as developed by Boyer and others.

From these assumptions, we introduce one hypothesis: that mass acts as a **sink** for radiation, absorbing zero-point energy from its surroundings and inducing a net momentum flux inward. This field modifies the trajectory of light and matter passing nearby, not by curving spacetime, but by shifting their momentum directly.

This hypothesis leads to a remarkably rich framework:

- It reproduces Newtonian gravity in the static limit.
- It predicts perihelion precession, light bending, and gravitational redshift, with results that match general relativity to first order.
- It implies an internal field energy that stabilizes the mass distribution, preventing collapse.
- And most strikingly, when reformulated using a spinor basis and a duality transformation, it yields the **Dirac equation**—without quantization, spin, or complex amplitudes.

This is not a final theory. There are open questions about higher-order corrections, strong fields, and how quantum probabilities emerge. But it is a new lens—one that connects gravity, electromagnetism, and elements of quantum theory using only classical machinery. It suggests that unification may not require new particles or dimensions, but simply a new way of looking at the old ones.

This paper builds the case step-by-step:

- We begin by constructing Maxwell-style gravitational equations and solving them in spherical symmetry.
- We then introduce our hypothesis and develop a model of a stable, massive particle.
- We test the theory against classical experiments.
- Finally, we reformulate the field equations in spinor form and show the emergence of the Dirac equation.

It is our hope that this new framework opens a path toward rethinking the relationship between classical and quantum physics, and that others will help extend or challenge it.

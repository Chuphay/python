Title (TBD)
A Classical Field Theory of Gravity Based on Radiation Momentum Flow

Abstract
(One-paragraph summary of the motivation, hypothesis, method, and main results.)

1. Introduction
Historical background: failures of GR/QM unification

Motivation for a new approach

Preview of assumptions and structure of paper

Summary of results: reproducing classical GR tests, recovering Dirac

2. Assumptions and Hypothesis
Radiation field assumed to be filled with stochastic background (ZPF)

Mass sinks radiation → induces directional momentum flow

Key hypothesis:

 
Connection to zero-point energy and cutoff frequency

3. Maxwell-Style Equations for Gravity
Modified field equations (Heaviside/Boyer-style)

Decomposition into irrotational and solenoidal parts

Field solutions, energy/momentum densities

Setup for duality and spinor formulation later

4. Stochastic Electrodynamics
Zero-point field background

Historical context (Boyer, Casimir, Puthoff)

Main equations and assumptions

Why ZPF is relevant to gravitational interaction

5. Massive Particles and the Main Hypothesis
Model of a massive particle as a radiation sink

Cutoff frequency derived from energy

Directional momentum flow derivation

Field energy and stability

Gravitational “Ohm’s law” and conservation of momentum

6. Classical Tests of Gravity
6.1 Perihelion Precession of Mercury

Gravito-magnetic correction

Effective potential

Agreement with GR

6.2 Light Bending Around a Mass

Momentum transfer to photons

Path integral

Reproduces GR deflection angle

6.3 Gravitational Redshift

Photon momentum gain falling into a well

Matches GR blue-shift at lowest order

7. Duality and Emergent Dirac Equation
7.1 Dual Transform (Jackson)

Electromagnetic symmetry

Motivation for rotating E/B components

7.2 Spinor Representation

Spinor structure from field tensors

Use of gamma matrices

7.3 Emergence of Dirac

Combined field equation in spinor form:

8. Discussion and Outlook
Interpretation: Is this a “force”?

Experimental testability (e.g. deviations at high frequency?)

Limitations: no entanglement, only classical field

Future directions: nonlinear effects, entropic gravity, full quantization?

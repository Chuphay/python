\section{The Unification Wow}

\subsection{Duality Transformations}

As discussed in Jackson (Section 6.11), the Maxwell equations can be extended to include both electric and magnetic charges:

\[
\nabla \times \vec{B} - \partial_t \vec{E} = \vec{J}_e, \quad
\nabla \times \vec{E} + \partial_t \vec{B} = -\vec{J}_m
\]

\[
\nabla \cdot \vec{E} = \rho_e, \quad
\nabla \cdot \vec{B} = \rho_m
\]

The magnetic densities are assumed to obey the same continuity equation as their electric counterparts.

Now consider the following duality transformation:

\[
\vec{E} = \vec{E}' \cos \xi + \vec{B}' \sin \xi, \quad
\vec{B} = \vec{B}' \cos \xi - \vec{E}' \sin \xi
\]

\[
\rho_e = \rho_e' \cos \xi + \rho_m' \sin \xi, \quad
\rho_m = \rho_m' \cos \xi - \rho_e' \sin \xi
\]

\[
\vec{J}_e = \vec{J}_e' \cos \xi + \vec{J}_m' \sin \xi, \quad
\vec{J}_m = \vec{J}_m' \cos \xi - \vec{J}_e' \sin \xi
\]

This transformation leaves the generalized Maxwell equations invariant. As Jackson notes, the distinction between electric and magnetic charge is, in this framework, a matter of convention. If all particles share the same magnetic-to-electric charge ratio, a duality rotation can eliminate magnetic charges entirely. This perspective opens the door for deeper reinterpretations of classical field theory.

\subsection{Spinor Representation of Field Operators}

We now examine a way to recast Maxwell’s equations using spinor-like objects.

Define the vector curl as a matrix operator:

\[
\nabla \times \vec{V} = g_i \partial_i \vec{V}
\]

with:

\[
g_1 = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1 \\
0 & 1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}, \quad
g_2 = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
-1 & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}, \quad
g_3 = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & -1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\]

Define the gamma matrices as:

\[
\gamma^0 = \begin{pmatrix}
-1 & 0 \\
0 & -1
\end{pmatrix}, \quad
\gamma^i = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & g_i \\
-g_i & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\]

These matrices are not the standard Dirac representation, but they serve to connect the structure of the field equations to the spinor formalism in a suggestive way. This could be further explored with tools from representation theory and Clifford algebras.

\subsection{Emergence of the Dirac Equation}

Recall from the section on momentum conservation that:

\[
\nabla \times \vec{B}_S - \partial_t \vec{E}_S = -\frac{m}{\hbar} \vec{E}_S \delta^3(\vec{x})
\]

Restricting attention to the surface of the particle (i.e., “on-shell”), we drop the delta function and write:

\[
\nabla \times \vec{B}_S - \partial_t \vec{E}_S = -\frac{m}{\hbar} \vec{E}_S
\]

Now, apply the duality transformation and write the solenoidal Maxwell equations in this form:

\[
-\partial_t \vec{E}_S + \nabla \times \vec{B}_S + \frac{m}{\hbar} \vec{E}_S = 0
\]

\[
-\partial_t \vec{B}_S - \nabla \times \vec{E}_S + \frac{m}{\hbar} \vec{B}_S = 0
\]

Using the spinor curl definition:

\[
-\partial_t \vec{E}_S + g_i \partial_i \vec{B}_S + \frac{m}{\hbar} \vec{E}_S = 0
\]

\[
-\partial_t \vec{B}_S - g_i \partial_i \vec{E}_S + \frac{m}{\hbar} \vec{B}_S = 0
\]

Now define a six-component field:

\[
\psi = \begin{pmatrix}
\vec{E}_S \\
\vec{B}_S
\end{pmatrix}
\]

We can combine the two equations above into a compact form:

\[
\left( \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu + \frac{m}{\hbar} \right) \psi = 0
\]

This has the exact form of the Dirac equation, as given in Sakurai’s _Advanced Quantum Mechanics_, Eq. 3.31.

This is a remarkable result: starting from classical field equations and a single added hypothesis, we arrive at a spinor field satisfying the Dirac equation—without invoking quantization or spin from the outset. It suggests that elements of quantum theory may emerge naturally from classical field dynamics under the right assumptions.

\section{Discussion and Outlook}

\subsection{Is This a Force?}

At first glance, the directional momentum flow described in this theory might resemble a gravitational force. But it is not. The core hypothesis postulates a field of momentum density sourced by mass and arising from asymmetric absorption of zero-point radiation. The resulting momentum transfer acts on light but cannot be described by \( \vec{F} = m \vec{a} \), nor does it require mass to accelerate—it is a field interaction, not a mechanical push.

This distinction is important. In this model, light does not bend due to spacetime curvature or inertial trajectories, but because its momentum is shifted by a background field. Whether this qualifies as a “force” depends on one's metaphysical commitments; mathematically, it is simply a field-driven momentum evolution.

\subsection{Experimental Implications and Testability}

At low frequencies, this theory reproduces the standard predictions of general relativity to first order: the perihelion precession of Mercury, bending of light, and gravitational redshift. However, the model contains a natural high-frequency cutoff, \( \omega_{\text{max}} = m/\hbar \), that suggests potential deviations from general relativity in high-energy regimes. 

This may provide a testable prediction: does light near extremely dense masses show slight deviation from GR’s trajectory at sub-Planckian wavelengths? Could precise interferometry or black hole lensing data reveal anomalies that hint at a momentum field with a frequency cutoff?

These are open questions, but the existence of a scale—where the theory must break or transition—is, arguably, a feature not a bug.

\subsection{Limitations of the Current Framework}

This theory is explicitly classical. It does not attempt to reproduce or explain entanglement, Bell violations, or other nonlocal quantum effects. It treats zero-point radiation as a real field, but it does not incorporate quantization of the field itself.

Likewise, no mechanism for spin, gauge symmetry, or quantized interaction vertices is included. The model focuses narrowly on reproducing gravitational behavior via field theory, not on building a replacement for quantum mechanics or QFT. The theory operates best in the semi-classical, single-particle domain.

\subsection{Future Directions}

A number of extensions suggest themselves. First, the behavior of nonlinear field interactions has not yet been analyzed—how do multiple nearby masses interact? Do waves interfere constructively or destructively? Is the radiation back-reaction linear?

Second, it would be valuable to explore whether a thermodynamic or entropic gravity formulation could emerge from this momentum flux model. Given that the field acts like a flow of energy and momentum, some form of entropic argument may provide further grounding.

Finally, full quantization is an open frontier. Is there a path from this classical field theory to a quantum field theory of gravity that retains the core insight—that mass sinks radiation—and reconciles it with quantum field dynamics?

These questions remain unanswered, but the framework introduced here offers a fresh angle and a stable platform from which to explore them.
